    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <section class="about-content">
      <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
      <p>
        As a Project Engineer, I bridge the gap between technical complexity and user experience. 
        My work spans from data analysis tools to automation pipelines, always with a focus 
        on creating solutions that people actually want to use.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Technical Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in Python, MATLAB, and SQL development, with deep experience in Linux 
        server administration and containerization. My homelab runs Proxmox and TrueNAS, 
        hosting everything from development environments to media servers.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Leadership & Values</h2>
      <p>
        Having served as an Infantry Mortar Squad Leader in the Army National Guard, 
        I understand the importance of clear communication, team dynamics, and mission success. 
        My goal is to eventually start a business where employees are genuinely happy, 
        fairly compensated, and excited about their work.
