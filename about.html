    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <section class="about-content">
      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>
        Originally from Osage, Iowa, I graduated from Iowa State University with a degree in Software Engineering. 
        During my college career, I completed a deployment overseas to the Middle East while serving in the 
        Army National Guard, which taught me invaluable lessons about leadership, adaptability, and working 
        under pressure. Now based in Detroit, Michigan, I'm open to relocating for the right opportunity 
        that offers growth and meaningful impact.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
      <p>
        As a Software Engineer at Excel Engineering, I bridge the gap between technical complexity and user experience. 
        My work spans from data analysis tools to automation pipelines for diesel emissions testing, always with a focus 
        on creating solutions that people actually want to use. I'm currently expanding my skills in full-stack 
        development during my free time while managing end-to-end project management at work.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Technical Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in Python, MATLAB, and SQL development, with deep experience in Linux 
        server administration and containerization. My homelab runs Proxmox and TrueNAS, 
        hosting everything from development environments to media servers. Currently, I'm diving 
        deeper into full-stack development and exploring modern web frameworks to complement 
        my automation and data analysis expertise.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Leadership & Values</h2>
      <p>
        Having served as an Infantry Mortar Squad Leader in the Army National Guard, 
        I understand the importance of clear communication, team dynamics, and mission success. 
        My goal is to eventually start a business where employees are genuinely happy, 
        fairly compensated, and excited about their work. I believe the best technology 
        is invisible to users while solving their actual problems effectively.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What I'm Currently Working On</h2>
      <p>
        At work, I'm focused on whole end-to-end project management for diesel emissions testing, 
        building automation tools that streamline complex workflows. In my free time, I'm learning 
        full-stack development to expand my technical toolkit. I'm always exploring new ways to 
        make technology more accessible and user-friendly, whether that's through better interfaces, 
        clearer documentation, or more intuitive automation workflows.
